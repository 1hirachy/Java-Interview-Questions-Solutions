# Java Interview Questions Solutions
### Welcome to the Java Interview Questions Solutions repository! This is a curated collection of common and challenging Java interview questions, along with detailed solutions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Java developer, this repository is designed to help you prepare for coding interviews by strengthening your understanding of Java fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

## Contents
### 1. Core Java Concepts:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Dive deep into fundamental principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, which are critical to Java development.
- **Exception Handling:** Learn how to manage errors effectively in Java, and understand the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
- **Collections Framework:** Explore `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, and more to efficiently manage and manipulate groups of objects.

### 2. Data Structures:
- Strengthen your knowledge of **data structures** commonly tested in Java interviews, including:
   - **Arrays**
   - **Linked Lists**
   - **Stacks**
   - **Queues**
   - **HashMaps**
   - **Trees**
   - **Graphs**
- Practice solving problems with these structures while focusing on time and space complexity.

### 3. Algorithms:
- Sharpen your problem-solving skills by mastering key algorithms, including:
   - **Sorting algorithms:** Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
   - **Searching algorithms:** Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
   - **Dynamic Programming:** Break problems into subproblems for optimal solutions.
   - **Greedy Algorithms:** Solve problems by making locally optimal choices at each step.

### 4. Concurrency & Multithreading:
- Learn the fundamentals of **multithreading** and **concurrency** in Java for building high-performance applications.
- Manage multiple threads, prevent race conditions, and ensure thread safety using **synchronization** and **Locks**.

### 5. Design Patterns:
- Familiarize yourself with common **design patterns** such as:
   - **Singleton**
   - **Factory**
   - **Observer**
   - And more...
- Understand how to implement and apply these patterns to create modular, maintainable, and scalable software.

### 6. String Manipulation:
- Master essential **String manipulation techniques** to solve real-world interview problems involving strings:
   - Reversing strings
   - Checking for palindromes
   - Manipulating substrings
   - Efficient string searches
